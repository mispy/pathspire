# Pathspire

A little roguelike puzzle game I made over the weekend. There are 12 floors of generally increasing difficulty.  Can be played here: https://pathspire.mispy.me/

Special thanks to the [Red Blob Games hex tutorial](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/), and to Reece Matthews for encouraging me to experiment!
